# midi2wav
A simple Ruby script to convert MIDI file(s) to WAV file(s) using TiMidity++ as the backend.

The usage is `midi2wav [FILE(S)]`. If you convert MIDI file(s) with .mid extension, you will get the WAV file(s) with .wav replacing the .mid of the original file(s) extension or else you will get WAV file(s) with .wav added to its end.

I'm not responsible of any damage the script caused. You need to use this script at your own risk.
